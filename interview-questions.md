# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

Your answer: Object-oriented programming focuses on using key/value pairs whereas functional programming puts an emphasis on using higher order functions?

Researched answer: OOP programming is more abstract because it has a focus on operating on keys directly instead of functional programming's declarative approach that requires explicit functions. As such, they have different methods for storing and handling data.


2. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

Your answer: A float is a decimal value and an Integer is a whole number value.

Researched answer: It's a simple question and the research answer confirms that any number written without decimals is an integer and if it has a decimal, it counts as a float. So here's a joke: Why should you never argue with a decimal? It's because they always have a point.


3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

Your answer: In JavaScript you must explicitly state return in order for scripts to return anything, however, in Ruby, every line has a return, even if it's not displayed to the user.

Researched answer: Because Ruby uses implicit returns (returning the value of the last line automatically), people enjoy writting short, elegant code. Explicitly using 'return' can even lead to errors in Ruby!

4. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: it's everything between a 'def' and 'end', it's the code, the script, and the instructions for the interpreter.

Researched answer: I was mistaken, there's actually another portion that is called a block. That's the code between curly braces. If a code is between a do and end / or {}, then it's a block.


5. What is an instance variable in Ruby?

Your answer: It's a variable that was made from a Class, while it has it's own unique hash identifier, it also has all the properties from it's Class, unless explicitly changed.

Researched answer: An instance variable is declared by prefacing it with the @ symbol. Any instance of the class will be able to have scope accessed to the instanced variable.
